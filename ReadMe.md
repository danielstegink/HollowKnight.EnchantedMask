# Enchanted Mask
Inspired by Lost Artifacts, this mod adds a whole new type of power to the game: Glyphs. 
As you traverse the game, you will unlock different glyphs which can be purchased from the Map Maker. 
You can only equip 1 glyph at a time, which will display as an icon in the top-left corner of your screen.

Each glyph has been assigned a tier based on how difficult it is to unlock. Higher-tier glyphs are more expensive and more powerful. 
 - Common glyphs are the easiest to unlock. They cost 500 geo and are as strong as 1-notch charms.
 - Uncommon glyphs are a little harder, roughly mid-game difficulty. They cost 1000 geo and are equivalent to 2-notch charms.
 - Rare glyphs are challenging, generally acquired in late game. They cost 2000 geo and are about as strong as 3-notch charms.
 - Epic glyphs are end-game difficulty. They cost 4000 geo and are as powerful as 4-notch charms.

The Glyphs page in your inventory will show all the glyphs you've acquired. 
The logic for equipping/unequipping a glyph is the same as that of charms. 
Each one will display its name, tier, and a description. 
If a glyph hasn't been unlocked, the description will provide a clue regarding how to unlock it.

You can find a detailed list of each glyph, its abilities, and how to get it in the SPOILERS file.

Additionally, the mod is has a sub-menu in Debug Mod for adding/removing glyphs from one's inventory.
